Initials:
Rado = rr
Angel = at
Ivon = in
Tanyo = tk

### Tasks
1. Input/Generate sequence /in/
2. Implement the data structure to hold the sequence /rr/
3. Implement Read/Write in files.
- Read /tk/
- Write /at/
5. Implement sorting algorithms:
- selection sort + measure execution time /tk/
- insertion sort + measure execution time /at/
- bubble sort + measure execution time /rr/
- merge sort + measure execution time /in/
- quick sort //
6. Display the measured time of each algorithm /at/
7. Visually compare the complexity /tk/ 

Rules:
1. Comment your code.
2. Document everything you do.
